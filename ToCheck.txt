These are just personal notes to make sure I go back and check:

Task 1: Make sure to only check product name, book author, and clothing brand 
Task 2: Make sure they run in nlogn
Task 3: Make sure everything was edited when copy/pasting header and cpp files
Task 5: Ensure search result is saved for add cart, make sure username vector is all
lowercase
**Make sure libraries are good
